# Routing Algorithms

 In this project, we implemented Distance Vector Algorithm and Link State Algorithm, which should be able to run over a network simulator. In addition, this project gave me an understanding of how OSPF and BGP work.
  
## Prerequisites

Install all of these libraries:

``` 
pip install --user networkx matplotlib
```

  if you find any error in the above command run this one:
  
```
pip3 install --user networkx matplotlib
 ```
## To run the code

To execute any of the algorithm run this command:
```
python3 sim.py GENERIC [eventfile]
```
To run only distance vector algorithm:
```
python3 sim.py DISTANCE_VECTOR [eventfile]
```

To run only Link State algorithm:
```
python3 sim.py LINK_STATE [eventfile]
```
