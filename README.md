# Computer-Networking

In this Course I created four different projects that were related to different domains of netowrking.

## Sockets and Servers [link](project1)

In this project, we build our own web server from scratch using low-level socket module in python

## Simplified TCP [link](project2)

We have designed a reliable streaming transport protocol on top of UDP. We have built a simplified version of TCP.

## Routing Algorithms [link](project3)

In this project, we implemented Distance Vector Algorithm and Link State Algorithm, which should be able to run over a network simulator. In addition, this project gave me an understanding of how OSPF and BGP work

## Network Tool Explorer [link](project4)

In this project we wrote a tool for network exploration and security auditing. The tool takes list of domains, it will return a report which contains certain network characterstics and security features of each domains.
